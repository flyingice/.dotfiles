" settings below are consistent with Vim/Neovim keymap

" code browsing
" peek documentation
nmap K <Action>(QuickJavaDoc)
" peek definition
" action name is misleading, but yes, it is for peeking definition
nmap gk <Action>(QuickImplementations)
nmap gK <Action>(QuickTypeDefinition)
nmap gd <Action>(GotoDeclaration)
nmap gt <Action>(GotoTypeDeclaration)
nmap gi <Action>(GotoImplementation)
nmap gr <Action>(ShowUsages)

" buffer list traversal
" vim default <C-^> works well to alternate between last two buffers
" ]b and [b work in ideal condition, however, the behavior becomes a
" mess if the order of existing buffers is changed (e.g. a new tab opened
" in-between). Thus we explicitly rebind them to NextTab/PreviousTab
" to have a predictable result.
nmap ]b <Action>(NextTab)
nmap [b <Action>(PreviousTab)
" diagnostic list traversal
nmap ]e <Action>(GotoNextError)
nmap [e <Action>(GotoPreviousError)

" code editing
nmap <Leader>= <Action>(ReformatCode)
nmap <Leader>c <Action>(RenameElement)
nmap <Leader>i <Action>(OptimizeImports)
nmap <Leader>ec <Action>(IntroduceConstant)
nmap <Leader>ev <Action>(IntroduceVariable)
vmap <Leader>ef <Action>(ExtractMethod)

" debugging
" functionalities of <Leader>dr and <F2> are slightly different from
" those of debug adapter protocol in Neovim, as DAP allows starting
" debug with continue() method call, while Debug and Resume are separate
" actions in IDEA
nmap <Leader>db <Action>(ToggleLineBreakpoint)
nmap <Leader>dr <Action>(Debug)
nmap <Leader>dk <Action>(QuickEvaluateExpression)
nmap <F2> <Action>(Resume)
nmap <F3> <Action>(StepOver)
nmap <F4> <Action>(StepInto)
nmap <F5> <Action>(StepOut)
nmap <F10> <Action>(Stop)

" toggle maximize current editor/normalize split
" set here as vim default doesn't work
nmap <C-w>= <Action>(MaximizeEditorInSplit)
" hide all windows, e.g., window showing `gr` results
nmap <C-w>o <Action>(HideAllWindows)
" rebind <C-o> and <C-i> as they don't always respect vim behaviour
" check related issue:
" https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/VIM-2225
nmap <C-o> <Action>(Back)
nmap <C-i> <Action>(Forward)

" show description of the error under the caret (<A-Enter> to select a fix)
nmap <A-k> <Action>(ShowErrorDescription)
" launch terminal
nmap <A-s> <Action>(Terminal.OpenInTerminal)
" toggle file explorer
nmap <A-t> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
" fzf keybinding simulation (double shift by default)
nmap <A-f> <Action>(SearchEverywhere)
